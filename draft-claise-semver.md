--- abstract

In the Internet engineering ecosystem, there is increasingly a need for
specifications that evolve over time, and are encoded directly in structured
formats (e.g., YANG models).  Internet-Drafts are a poor fit for working groups
that want to produce structured specifications, and publishing versions of an
evolving specification as RFC makes it difficult to track the specification
over time.  This document outlines recommendations for how working groups can
provide semantic versioning for, and work directly on, structured documents while
still fitting within established IETF processes.

# Introduction

The pace at which the software that drives the Internet is developed and
deployed today is much faster than it was early in the Internet's history.  In
this environment, maintaining interoperability can be more challenging.

Two of the major mechanisms that have been developed for driving
interoperability in a more dynamic ecosystem are semantic versioning and
structured specifications.  Structured specifications allow much of the work of
implementing a specification to be automated, so that developers can focus on
the parts of a specification that really need human involvement.  Semantic
versioning helps operators know what versions can be deployed without breaking
running systems, so that they can safely deploy updated versions of a specification
more quickly.

The traditional practices of the IETF interact poorly with these mechanisms.
Each document presented to the IETF for last call and IESG approval must be
formatted as an Internet-Draft, i.e., as unstructured text.  All RFCs across
the IETF share a single, common numbering space, so that RFC numbers have no
useful semantic with respect to versioning.  Nonetheless, there is still a
need to be able to capture the consensus of the IETF at critical points in
the life-cycle of a specification.

This document describes recommendations for how a working group (WG) that wishes
to produce structured specifications with semantic version numbers can interact
best with IETF processes.


# Managing Semantic Versions

While some of this process might apply to completely new work (such as a YANG 
module), the process in this document applies to WG adopted work items or to
modification of an existing IETF-approved work item (typically a bis document
).

We start from the premise that a working group controls a version-controlled
repository (e.g., Git, SVN, etc.) for a structured specification (not formatted
as an Working Group Internet-Draft), and can "tag" commits in the repository as having
certain version numbers.  We assume that there is one repository per
specification, so that version tags don't need to specify which specification
they refer to.

The recommended structure for semantic versions follows the widely-used
three-part convention, with an additional field for use in working group
processes:

~~~~~
  MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
~~~~~

The fields in such a structured version have the following semantics (cf.
semver.org):

* MAJOR is incremented when the new version of the specification
  is incompatible with previous versions.
* MINOR is incremented when new functionality is added in a manner that is
  backward-compatible with previous versions.
* PATCH is incremented when bug fixes are made in a backward-compatible manner.


In IETF terms, this versioning scheme provides functionality analogous to
several parts of the traditional IETF process.

* MAJOR is analogous to an "obsoletes" relation between RFCs
* MINOR is analogous to an "updates" relation between RFCs
* PATCH is analogous to use of the RFC errata process


The more major a change to the specification, the more consensus is required.
When the WG wants to make a MAJOR change to a structured specification, the
specification MUST be converted into Internet-Draft format and run through the
typical IETF consensus process. Every commit that is tagged with a MAJOR
version change MUST also have a tag indicating the number of the RFC describing
the change.

For MINOR changes, WG consensus is required. The WG chairs can additionally
decide whether IETF consensus is required. Any change to the structured
specification that significantly changes the security considerations for the
protocol or requires additional IANA actions MUST be converted into
Internet-Draft format and submitted for IETF consensus.  Changes without such
impacts MAY be approved by consensus of the working group. PATCH-level changes
MAY be made by the editors, with the consent of the WG chairs.

When a working group starts up work on a new version of the specification,
regardless of whether it's a minor update or a complete rewrite, they SHOULD
create a dedicated branch of the repository for the new version, where changes
related to the new version will be committed.  The semantic version, i.e. MAJOR 
and MINOR is assigned when this branch is merged back to the main specification.
Once there is consensus to update the main specification to that version, the 
branch should be merged, and the merge commit tagged with the new version number.

When working on modification to an existing work item (typically a bis document), 
the process is to fork a git repo, branch, make a proposal, then push the branch
back over to the Working Group when/if the Working Group adopts it.

## Versioning for Work in Progress

It can be useful to mark certain versions of a work in progress as checkpoints,
e.g., for reference at a hackathon.  These checkpoints should follow their own
version sequence, much like Internet drafts:

~~~~~
  LABEL-VERSION
~~~~~

* LABEL is a string that identifies the feature branch
* VERSION is incremented whenever a new revision is tagged

These tags are analogous to Internet-Draft names. Much like an Internet-Draft
name, the choice of LABEL values is up to the editors and WG chairs. In cases
what they expect the completed work to result in a given version, then they
might use that as a label value.  For example, if the WG has agreed to embark
on a major revision to the protocol, then they might use the label
"v2.0.0-beta", so that the working revisions would be "v2.0.0-beta-0",
"v2.0.0-beta-1", etc.

It's important to note that not every commit needs a version.  Much like
working groups using Github to manage Internet-Drafts today only periodically
submit them to the IETF, a WG can do work in a repository and only tag versions
when they are useful to the WG.  Beta versions should be tagged at key points
in the development process:

* Before an IETF meeting or WG interim meeting
* Before a hackathon or interop event
* Before a working group or IETF last call

Work on a new version SHOULD be conducted on a dedicated branch.  Once there is
consensus to update the main specification to that version, the branch should
be merged, and the merge commit tagged with the new version number.


# IETF Consensus for Structured Specifications

While working groups may use any format for specifications under development,
the Internet Standards process requires that a document proposed as an RFC must
be submitted in the RFC format, i.e., as unstructured text.  Proposed RFCs are
also required to contain explanatory text not typically contained in structured
specifications, most notably Security Considerations and IANA Considerations.
Thus, a working group that is focused mainly on a structured specification will
have to convert the structured specification to the RFC format and add the
additional explanatory text.

In order to keep the repository as the primary home for the specification, the
working group should keep any required explanatory text in the repository
alongside the structured specification, and use automated tools to generate an
RFC-formatted document from the artifacts in the repository.  As the outputs
are reviewed in the IETF last call and IESG processes, the editors should
reflect their responses in the repository, generating updated versions of the
RFC-formatted document as necessary.

Whenever an Internet-Draft is generated from the repository, the corresponding
commit in the repository should be tagged with the full name and version of the
Internet-Draft.  Additionally, a reference to the repository (e.g., a URL)
should exist in the text of the resulting Internet-Draft.  These steps enable
the evolution of the draft to easily be tied back to the evolution of the
repository.


# Example history

The below sequence of commits and tags shows the progress of a structured
specification through several stages of its life-cycle.  (Time flows up from
the bottom, as is common in version control logs.)

An initial version of a protocol is proposed for a Birds of a Feather (BoF) and
a WG is formed. The WG develops version 1.0.0 of the specification.  Along the
way, they tag betas when they need an easy way to refer to a version, e.g.,
before working group last call (WGLC).

Once the WG has reached consensus, an Internet-Draft is created from the
repository (draft-ietf-wg-proto-00) and submitted for the IETF consensus
process, resulting in an RFC (RFC XXX1) that describes the first version of the
protocol. In this example, there is never a need to publish an individual
(author-named) internet-draft, because the WG worked directly on the structured
specification and obtained consensus on it.

Comments from the IETF last call (LC) and the IESG are incorporated in the
repository, and new versions of the Internet-Draft are generated for IESG
review and submission to the RFC editor.

The WG adds two features to the specification.  The first feature is major
enough that the chairs decide it needs IETF consensus, resulting in a second
Internet-Draft going through the IETF consensus process
(draft-ietf-wg-proto-feature-00) to become an RFC (RFC XXX2).  The second
feature is minor enough that it can be approved by WG consensus.

This example history is greatly simplified.  In a real WG, there will be far
more commits without versions, as the WG incorporates proposals, edits
explanatory text, etc.  But this example highlights the key moments in the
life-cycle of a specification.


# Creating Internet-Drafts from a Repository

As noted above, WGs should have one repository per specification.  Over the
lifetime of the specification, it will be necessary for automated tools to
build Internet-Drafts from this repository.  A standardized repository layout
can help automate this process.

The root level of the repository should have a file named `index.xml` or
`index.md`, depending on whether [XML](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991) or
[Markdown](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/wiki/Syntax) is being used.  This
file should itself be a valid source for an Internet-Draft, including
information about the title to be used, authors' / editors' names, security
considerations, etc.  It will act as a template into which the structured
specification will be included when an Internet-Draft is created.

The template file should include files that comprise the structured
specification as figures at appropriate points in the draft.  The Markdown
syntax provided by `mmark` provides a syntax for including [code
fragments](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/wiki/Syntax#including-code-fragments)
from external files, including the ability to selectively include parts of a
file.
